# Tiny Apps

This folder is a repository of some small scripts I have coded to support research or work, but are not related to research itself. I made them available both for teaching purposes (my students might get some inspiration) and to potentially make the life of my fellow researchers easier.

# List of apps

* [PyComtrade](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/tree/master/tinyapps/PyComtrade): implements the International Trade Statistics database API, pulls up data for partners, and years requested, and organize them into a Pandas DataFrame.

* [USPTO Scrapping](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/tree/master/tinyapps/PyComtrade): This script scrapes the data on patent counts by origin and type, available on the website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as a html table, and organizes it in a Pandas DataFrame.
